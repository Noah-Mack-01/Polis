## Polis - A Social Plugin
Polis is a Minecraft Plugin using PaperMC 1.18 to create a hierarchical system of social agency and joint venture.<br>
It is crafted upon the following principles:

  - People are actors with agency and wealth.
  - People are capable of impacting one another through relationships and contract.
  - People are capable of sacrificing both their agency, wealth and impact on one another for the sake of greater collective benefit.
  - This sacrifice forms social groups, which have the same underlying traits as a person, which do the same for larger organizations.

In short, it allows for the formation, joining and leaving of **Factions**, the establishment of fiscal **Contracts** as well as **Taxation** on trade, permanent **Treasury**, the creation of **Diplomatic Agreement**, the waging of **War** and more!
